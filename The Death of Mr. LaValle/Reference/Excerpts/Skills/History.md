Excerpt:
> Uncovering facts and theories about human antiquity. Use it to remember or find a key fact about the distant past, recognize an obscure reference, or comb a database or library for information that nobody without your deep education could find. While Anthropology is about living cultures and Archaeology studies the meaning of ancient relics, History is a broad study of humanity.

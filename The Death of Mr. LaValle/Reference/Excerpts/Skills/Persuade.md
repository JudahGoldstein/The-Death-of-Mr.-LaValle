Excerpt:
> Changing another’s deeply-held decision or desire. Use Persuade to get your Agent’s way when the subject is so stubborn, what your Agent wants is so valuable, or the deception is so flagrant that Charisma isn’t enough. With Persuade, your Agent might convince a witness that what she saw was innocuous and not unnatural, talk a detective into helping you cover up evidence for the greater good, or draw useful intelligence out of an unwilling subject.

Excerpt:
> Finding things that are concealed or obscured from plain sight. Searching a scene may not require the Search skill, only time and effort, or a sufficiently high INT. Use Search to find an object that was hidden with the Stealth skill, or is otherwise so well hidden or disguised that it needs an expert. **The Handler may roll the Search attempt so you donâ€™t know whether your Agent succeeded or failed**. 

Note:
The highlighted section is highly encouraged to enhance the mystery aspect of the scenario.

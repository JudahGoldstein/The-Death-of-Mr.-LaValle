Excerpt:
> The study of the supernatural as understood by human traditions, including things like conspiracy theories, fringe science, and cryptozoology. Use Occult to examine and deduce the intent of a ritual, or to identify occult traditions, groups, grimoires, tools, symbols, or legends. Occult can never tell an Agent what’s genuinely unnatural and what’s just superstition or mythology. That’s the province of the Unnatural skill.

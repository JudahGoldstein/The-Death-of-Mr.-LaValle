Any well-balanced team should be fine for this particular scenario. The skills of the players can change the nature of the clues they discover. Some skills that may be of particular importance for this scenario include [[Medicine]], [[History]], [[Occult]], [[Art|Visual Arts]], and [[Search]], along with social skills like [[HUMINT]] and [[Persuade]].
Some suggested professions that would be a good fit for this scenario include [[Historian]], [[Physician]], [[Intelligence Case Officer]], [[Media Specialist]], [[Foreign Service Officer]], [[Lawyer]], or a [[Federal Agent]] with an investigation focused skill bonus package like [[Interrogator]] or [[Occult Investigator]].
This is a no~low combat scenario, if a player wants to make a more combat-centred character perhaps guide them towards a combat oriented bonus skill package like [[Combat Veteran]], [[Deep Cover]], [[Military Officer]], [[Police Officer]], or [[Soldier]]. But don't worry too much if a player insists on a combat oriented profession, they should still be able to find a niche with some extra effort.

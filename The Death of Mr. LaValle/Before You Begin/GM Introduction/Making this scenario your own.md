As you can probably tell by now I approach scenario creation in a conversational fashion, I'm of the belief that there is no “right” way to run a supplement, if your table runs this scenario identically to how my table runs it I consider that a failure on my part, at that point I may as well have written a novel, not a tabletop supplement. Running a scenario from a supplement is an act of adaptation, not presentation, own that, I'm the author of this supplement, *you* are the author of your table's story. 

The most important thing is that you understand the narrative intentions than memorizing specific plot points. I will give references throughout, timelines, handouts, etc... But you shouldn't feel pressure to stick with them. As long as you understand the goals a scene is going for you should be able to go way off the beaten path and still arrive at the same destination satisfyingly.
